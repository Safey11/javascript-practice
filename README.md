# ðŸš€ My JavaScript Learning Journey  

Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript from a **paid Udemy course**.  
To help others, Iâ€™m sharing **my own practice code, exercises, and projects** here for free.  
âš¡ Everything here is written by me while learning â€” so anyone can benefit without needing the course.
